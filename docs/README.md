# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This README provides a summary of the project management processes used at OctoAcme, with quick links to detailed process guides contained in this directory.

## Project Management Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured lifecycle with clear roles, iterative delivery, and a focus on customer value and stakeholder alignment. Key elements of our project management framework include:

- **Project Initiation & Stakeholder Alignment:** Validate work, align all key players, and set measurable outcomes before planning begins.
- **Planning & Backlog Creation:** Define actionable work items, scope, milestones, and responsibilities with prioritization and estimation.
- **Execution, Tracking & Quality:** Deliver iteratively, track progress via project boards, and ensure quality with robust testing and regular demos.
- **Risk Management & Communication:** Maintain a risk register, manage dependencies, communicate progress and blockers, and escalate as needed.
- **Release & Deployment:** Follow standardized checklists, requirements, and playbooks for a predictable and resilient release process.
- **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement:** Capture learnings after each iteration, enforce follow-up on action items, and improve process iteratively.
- **Defined Roles & Personas:** Clearly described responsibilities and communication expectations for each core role ensure alignment and smooth operations.
